# housing sim
A monte carlo simulation of the housing market using Python

Just for fun, would it be possible to do a monte carlo simulation that explains where this crazy housing market is going?

Working with some simple variables it would be interesting to see what the end state is for the world economy. 

Will we all end up as renters or owners? What impact do the different variables have on affordability and equality?

Ideas for variables:
- interest rates and trend (rising/falling/flat)
- savings rate
- investors purchasing houses
- wages, living expenses and inflation
- age and propensity to buy (children don't buy, people in 30's want to have families, etc)
- new supply of housing (vs. demand?)
- beginning state: investors, renters, cash available, living expenses
